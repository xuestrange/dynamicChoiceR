#1) Number of States and Transitions
# In this paper, the agent observes each bus at a given time t, and makes 
# a decision regarding the replacement of the engine or its maintenance as a 
# function of the observed state of the engine (i.e. its mileage).

# As in the original paper, we discretize the number of states into 
# intervals of length 5000, and define a transition density which governs 
# the evolution of mileage from one time period to another:

  # p(x_t+1|x_t,i_t,theta_3) = g(x_t+1-x_t,theta_3) if i_t=0
  #                          = g(x_t+1-0,theta_3) if i_t=1

# Here, the function g is defined by a multinomial distribution on 
# the set {0, 1, 2}. In other words, the probability that a bus'
# mileage will increase by a value x between now and the next 
# maintenance decision is:

  # theta_31 if x in c(0,5000)
  # theta_32 if x in c(5001,10000)
  # theta_33 = 1-(theta_31-theta_32) if  x > 10000

#2) Decision Criteria

# The utility function of the decision maker for a single time period is:

  # u(x_t,i,theta_1) = -c(x_t,theta_1) + e_t(0) if i = 0
  #                  = -RC-c(x_t,theta_1) + e_t(1) if i = 1

# The agent will chose the decision which maximizes its utility. 
# If the agent is forward looking (i.e. if beta != 0), he does 
# not only maximize his utility in the present time period, but 
# also his future utility discounted by beta

# Since beta cannot be estimated without knowing the 
# utility function, we will later set beta to its true value.

# 3) Cost Function 

# A functional form has to be imposed on the cost function c(x_t).

# In this recreation, we assume that the replacement cost is a constant RC, 
# and allow the maintenance cost MC(s,theta_1) to be a linear, exponential 
# or logarithmic function of the state of the bus scaled by a 
# parameter theta_1 8【0与

#DATA GENERATING PROCESS--------------------------------------------

# 1) Bus Mileage

# A. Introduction
# The generation of a fake dataset can be done in two different ways:
#  -Generating monthly mileage increase from a continuous distribution, discretize the mileage, 
#   and recover the state transition parameters (theta_3) using a maximum-likelihood estimation 
#   (as done in the paper).
#  -Set the vector theta_3 to an arbitrary value, and generate discrete states transitions 
#   with corresponding probabilities.

# The advantage of the first method is that this is closer to what is actually done in the paper: 
# indeed, the focal goal of the paper is to recover RC and the cost scaling vector of parameters theta_1.

# If the decision of the agent is based on the discretized state (and not on the actual mileage), 
# then this approach is not noisier than the second one.

# B. Mileage Transition Definition
# For this reason, we will adopt this first approach, and assumes that the increase in mileage
# follows a truncated normal distribution bounded at [0, 15000]:

  # (M_t+1-M_t)~NTrunc(6000,4000)

# The parameters are arbitrarily chosen to ensure that the state transitions probabilities are plausible:

lower <- 0
upper <- 15000
mu <- 6000
sigma <- 4000

p_x0 <- ptnorm(5000, mu, sigma, lower, upper)
p_x1 <- ptnorm(10000, mu, sigma, lower, upper) - p_x0
p_x2 <- 1 - p_x1 - p_x0
p <- c(p_x0, p_x1, p_x2)

p

#p[1] chance of keeping the same mileage, p[2] chance of increasing the mileage state by 1, p[3] chance of increasing the mileage state by 2

#2) Agent's Decisions

# A. Initialization of the variables
# The replacement cost, the maintenance cost function parameters, and the discount rate
# are defined in this section. We set up the discount rate to be lower than in the paper
# to speed up the convergence of the contraction mapping algorithm

# We treat the dataset as an N_Bus x 4 array, containing:
# -The identifier of the buses
# -The choice made for the buses at this time
# -The mileage
# -The states

# B. State transition functions

# The dataset of buses transition from one period to another in the following way:
# -The agent observes the current state of the buses, and take a decision to maintain (0) or replace (1) each bus.

# -The mileage of each bus is updated a first time:
#   -Kept at its current value if the agent decided to maintain the engine
#   -Reset to 0 if the agent decided to replace the engine

# -The mileage of each bus is updated a second time : a random draw is taken from the 
#   mileage increment random variable for each bus, and the corresponding mileage is added 
#   to the mileage of the bus.

# -The state of each bus is updated to reflect its new mileage
